\section{Motivation:}
Computational modelling is a vital part of the empirical cycle, formalizing
existing knowledge and experimental data in a systematic way. Existing methods
and tools are not accessible enough to the biological community, hampering
widespread application in biological research.
\section{Results:}
Here we present an intuitive modeling approach, supported
by a user-friendly software tool, ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive
MOdeling). An ANIMO model of signal transduction events
downstream of TNF$\alpha$ and EGF in HT-29 human colon carcinoma
cells is described as a showcase.
\section{Availability and implementation:}
ANIMO is implemented as a plug-in to the network visualization tool Cytoscape
and can be downloaded from \url{http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/animo}.
Additional information and a step-by-step installation guide can be found
in Supplementary Section~\ref{sec:animo-installation}. A user manual is 
provided in Supplementary Section~\ref{sec:animo-manual}.
